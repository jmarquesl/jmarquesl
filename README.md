### üöÄ About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate about software development and agile methodologies. My mission is to empower teams to deliver high-quality software by leveraging all available tools to ensure rapid and continuous feedback on every aspect of the product.

I firmly believe that for an agile team to thrive, it must foster continuous improvement and allow its members to adapt to challenges. This enables robust solutions aligned with business needs while keeping the people behind the software at the heart of the process.
